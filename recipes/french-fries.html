  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>French fries are potatoes that are prepared by cutting them into sticks and frying them in hot oil until they are golden brown and crispy, then removing them from the oil and seasoning them with salt.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Sunflower oil</li>
    <li>Potatoes</li>
    <li>Salt to taste</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Peel the potatoes and cut them into strips, let them soak in cold water for 30 minutes and then dry them well! This last is important, the potatoes must be completely dry before putting them in oil.</li>
    <li>Put plenty of oil in a pot and heat it well. Remember that it is very important not to skimp on oil. As mentioned above in the tips, it is important that the potatoes are completely submerged in oil. When the oil is hot lower the heat before placing the potatoes.
    </li>
    <li>Fry the potatoes until they are just cooked. If you are going to continue with this recipe the potatoes should not be browned in the first frying since we will finish browning them in the second one, and this is the main secret for the french fries to be crispy. While the potatoes are frying, place them in a bowl with kitchen paper to absorb the oil.</li>
    <li>You can put the fries in the refrigerator or leave them in a cold place to lower the temperature. The potatoes must be completely cold (not lukewarm) to take them to the second frying.
    </li>
    <li>We repeat the frying process again, this time we are going to make sure that the potatoes are golden brown. Be careful! do not overdo it, because if they are too much they will become soft again. Let them cool for 5 minutes before salting and then serve them hot!</li>
  </ol>
